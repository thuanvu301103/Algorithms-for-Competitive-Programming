# Algorithms-for-Competitive-Programming
This repository implements a collection of algorithms as described on the website ```https://cp-algorithms.com/```

## Structure Overview
```css
myutils/
|
|-- include/
|   |-- myutils/
|       |-- myutils.hpp         # main header
|
|-- src/                        # source code
|   |-- myutils.cpp
|
|-- tests/
|   |-- testUtils.cpp           # usage demo
|
|-- makefile                    # ussed for compile library
```

## Compile static library
Run makefile:
``
make
``

## Run the test
Chnage the functions to be called then run ```main.cpp```
